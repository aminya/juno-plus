# Juno-Toolbar-Plus Atom package
This is a simple Atom's package that enhances Julia Client Toolbar by adding some useful buttons.

### Installation
https://atom.io/packages/juno-toolbar-plus

### Files and Folders
* Open Folder - useful for opening and developing a project/package
* Select Julia working directory

### Process:
* Restart Julia (which removes workspace)
* Erase console
* Show documentation of selection

### Code Tools:
* Bookmarks
* Fold all - Unfold all: useful for code overview
* Auto Indent Selection (faster than Julia-Client formatting button)

### Viewers:
* Markdown preview: for previewing Readme.md if the package is already installed

### Atom utilities:
* Open Settings
* Fullscreen
* Command Palette


### Installation Tip:
After installation, if the Julia Client icons are still present, you might need to reload/restart Atom 2 times! (because this package adjusts Julia Client and Tool-bar config settings).
