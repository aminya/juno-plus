# Juno-Toolbar-Plus Atom package
This is a simple Atom's package that enhances Julia Client Toolbar by adding some useful buttons.

### Installation
https://atom.io/packages/juno-toolbar-plus

### Files and Folders
* Open Folder - useful for opening and developing a project/package
* Select Julia working directory
### Process:
* Restart Julia (which removes workspace)
* Erase console
* Fold all - Unfold all: useful for code overview
### Code Tools:
* Auto Indent Selection (faster than Julia-Client formatting button)
* Show documentation of selection
### Viewers:
* Markdown preview: for previewing Readme.md if the package is already installed
### Atom utilities:
* Open Settings
* Fullscreen
* Command Palette


### Installation Tip:
After installation, if the Julia Client icons are still present, you might need to reload/restart Atom 2 times! (because this package adjusts Julia Client and Tool-bar config settings).

### Background: 
originally it was supposed to be merged to Julia Client, but the developers recommended to create a separate package. They may add this to uber-Juno installation.

If you have any suggestions, I would be happy to include.
